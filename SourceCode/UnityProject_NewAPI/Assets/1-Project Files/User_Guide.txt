Before you begin:

#Downloaded Unity 2021.1.22f1 in order to avoid version conflicts

1- Git clone repository
2- git lfs fetch -all
3- git lfs pull
4- Check Project Settings>Player> Configuration>API Comp Level set to -NET 4.x
5- Unity shouldn't throw unknown errors now.
6- Disable auto jump detector.
	- ProgramData/Teslasuit/teslasuit_api.config.xml
	- Set true in the following line: <without_jumps type="bool">true</without_jumps>


1- Scripts under "1-Project Files\Scripts" aren't originally
a part of the TeslaSuit's own API. But the gameObjects used in
the scenes are. That's why don't delete the old API no matter what!

2- Notice some changes have been made in the package
as well. Those changes have been marked with   //*
For an example TsHumanAnimator.cs

3- API could get new upgrades over time. Deleting the old 
one in order to upgrade to the new API, would probably break
the code irreversibly. In this case create a seperate Unity
Project, make the necesseray changes there and transfer the
files from this project to that one. As long as the data types
stay same like enums, dictionaries, the project should work fine
