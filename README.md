# Recognizing Full-Body Activity Execution Errors using the Teslasuit

We developed a method for movement assessment using a full-body haptic motion capture suit. Towards this end, we train probabilistic movement models using the data of 10 inertial sensors of the Teslasuit (https://teslasuit.io) to detect exercise execution errors. The results based on a dataset collected from 15 subjects (see the demonstration video below) show that the approach can detect severe movement execution errors directly during the workout and provide haptic feedback at respective body locations.
