# Recognizing Full-Body Activity Execution Errors using the Teslasuit

We propose a method for movement assessment using a full-body haptic motion capture suit. Towards this end, we train probabilistic movement models using the data of 10 inertial sensors of the Teslasuit (https://teslasuit.io) to detect exercise execution errors. The results based on a dataset collected from 15 subjects (see EvaluationData folder) show that the approach can detect severe movement execution errors directly during the workout and provide haptic feedback at respective body locations.
